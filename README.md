# 02456 Deep Learning final project
This repository contains code for the 02456 deep learning F19 final report.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The notebooks is created using python 3.7. To run the code in jupyter notebooks, be sure to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

To run the notebooks install the libraries listed below:
* neural_structured_learning
* tensorflow
* csv
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib

The installation process is straight forward.

```
pip install neural-structured-learning
```

```
pip install tensorflow
```

```
pip install csv
```

```
pip install pandas
```

```
pip install matplotlib
```

To run the grakn database first download grakn from their [webpage](https://grakn.ai/download). Load the script into the enviroment and you are ready to test out the data.

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

<!-- ## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
``` -->

<!-- ### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system -->

## Built With
