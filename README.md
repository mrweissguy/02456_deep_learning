# 02456 Deep Learning final project
## CONTROLLED GENERATION OF PROTEINS USING CONDITIONALCHARACTER-LEVEL RNN
### *Project 6, Bioinformatics - Can be generate specific proteins?*
This repository contains code for the 02456 deep learning F19 final report.

It contains:
* datasets used for experiments in the report.
	* PennTreeBank charcter and word level datasets
* jupyter notebook used to obtain main results.
* weights for the models trained.
* UPDATE THIS WHEN DONE....

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The notebooks is created using python 3.7. To run the code in jupyter notebooks, be sure to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or run it in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

To run the notebooks install the libraries listed below:

* pytorch


The installation process is straight forward.

```
pip install torch
```


To recreate the results from the report, please look at each individual notebook. As default, they are set to continue training on the weights in the nets folder.

To simply load the results and see the train/valid error during training, run the SOMETHING FUNCTION. The correct model with the correct parameters will need to be instantiated before it can be run. 

<!-- ### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

<!-- ## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
``` -->

<!-- ### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system -->

## Built With
